# School Day Simulator

Welcome to School Day Simulator, a program made to help designers and architects simulate how a school layout would perform in terms of ease of travel. It helps identify high-traffic areas in the school, and allows a designer to mitigate these issues. While this was designed for schools, it could be used for a variety of other buildings. The hope is that this program makes better schools for all

## Instructions

- `WASD` to move
- `+` or `-` to zoom in or out
- `Up arrow` and `Down arrow` to move up and down floors
- `1`-`6` to change the tile type
- Press the same number to cycle through different variants of that tile
- `click` to place the tile
- `Enter` to save the school layout to `data/school.txt`
  - If you want to keep a school layout, but also create a new one, simply rename the current `data/school.txt` file
  - If you want to load that layout again, rename it back to `school.txt`
- Once you are happy with the school layout, press `space` to start/restart the simulation
- `p` to toggle showing paths
